<p> A Wisdom King is a type of wrathful deity in East Asian Buddhism.Whereas the Sanskrit name is translated literally as "wisdom / knowledge king(s)," the term vidya (IAST: vidyā) in Vajrayana Buddhism is also specifically used to denote mantras;[1] the term may thus also be rendered "mantra king(s)."[2][3] Vidya is translated in Chinese with the character 明 (lit. "bright, radiant", figuratively "knowledge(able), wisdom, wise"), leading to a wide array of alternative translations such as "bright king(s)" or "radiant king(s)". A similar category of fierce deities known as Herukas are found in Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
